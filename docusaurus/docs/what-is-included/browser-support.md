By default, this boilerplate is configured to support the latest two versions of the most popular desktop and mobile browsers.

You can find a list of what browsers this boilerplate supports [here](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%202%20Chrome%20versions%2C%20last%202%20Firefox%20versions%2C%20last%202%20Safari%20versions%2C%20last%202%20Edge%20versions%2C%20last%202%20ChromeAndroid%20versions%2C%20last%202%20iOS%20versions).

We're configuring our list of supported browsers in the `browserlist` propertry of our `package.json` file. Feel free to change it in case your default browser support doesn't suit your project.
