Creating your own isomorphic application from the ground up can be very challenging and cumbersome.
Having a base configuration with many features available out of the box makes it so developers can quickly start developing their own applications.

This boilerplate offers an opinionated stack that's ready to kick-start your projects!
To start with our stack, we introduce to you [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a React framework built to provide SSR with rehydration. This means that using Next.js you can build applications that will render on the server whenever possible, and, whenever necessary, let the client handle cases where client side rendering is inevitable (e.g., reactable pages).

It's an open-source project that has gained a lot of community traction and is currently our preferred option for SSR React applications.

If you wish to learn more about Next.js, we recommend taking a look at [their documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started).
