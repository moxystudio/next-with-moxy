# Docusaurus

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](http://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
npm i
```

Or if you're in the root of the project, run:

```
npm i --prefix docusaurus
```

### Local Development

```
npm run start
```

Or if you're in the root of the project, run:

```
npm run docs

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
