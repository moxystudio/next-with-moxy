# next-with-moxy

MOXY's boilerplate to create Next.js based applications

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and was bootstrapped manually using MOXY's most used presets for tooling.

## Motivation

Isomorphic JavaScript applications could be pretty challenging and hard to setup.

With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) server rendering React applications become a lot easier, but there is always a need to configure some more specefic tooling for our projects.

`next-with-moxy` offers you the required tooling for your universal JavaScript application, as well as an opinionated frontend stack ready to kick-off your next project.
